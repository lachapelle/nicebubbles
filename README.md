This is an addon that styles the chat bubbles appearing in the game world to be smaller, less intrusive, and not so much in the way of what is happening on the screen. It has no user options, but sets the size of the bubbles based on your selected font size in the default chat frame.

The idea is to clear up screen space while still having the bubbles visible, so you can pay attention to both what is happening and to what people and NPCs are saying, without having your eyes going ping pong back and forth from the screen and chat frame.

Look at the screenshot to see the addon in action, as it shows an example of a restyled chat bubble from a monster attacking the player.

## Buy me a beer
Making stuff like this and all of my other addons takes a boatload of time and effort. I do it because I love doing it, because I believe that it makes the game better. But still, a lot of hours is put into it. 

It is in no way required, since my addons always has been and always will be free and fully available to everybody without restrictions. But if you truly wish to support my hard work, a donation goes a long way! Because nothing is quite as motivating as beer money! :D
